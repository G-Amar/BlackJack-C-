OOP featuers are used to create various things needed for this such as Cards, Hands, and Decks.

When starting up the program, you will be greeted with this form:

Here, you can Hit or Stand, upon finishing the round, close the window via the 'X' or 'Close' button to be returned to the 1st form to continue playing. Your balance will be updated when you win. You can have multiple games running at once.
